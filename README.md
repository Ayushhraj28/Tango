# Project TANGO: Autonomous Assistive Tank <br/>
### By: Ayush Raj, Jason Naicker, Adrian Aguayo, Yousef El Shenawy
 

## Overview <br/>
Project TANGO is an innovative autonomous tank designed with a mission to empower individuals with mobility challenges. Built to navigate complex environments, TANGO safely and reliably delivers a handicapped user to a designated location. Combining engineering with user-centered design, TANGO embodies our vision of practical, automated assistive technology.<br/>

## Project Highlights<br/>
Design, Creation & Implementation: From the ground up, we conceptualized, designed, and built an autonomous robotic tank chassis equipped to handle varied terrains.<br/><br/>
Autonomous Navigation: Through an advanced drivetrain and integrated sensor array, TANGO autonomously detects obstacles, navigates surroundings, and adjusts its path for optimal safety and efficiency.<br/><br/>
Assistive Claw Mechanism: TANGO includes a precise, automated claw mechanism for enhanced interaction, designed to handle objects and aid the user in completing tasks along the journey.<br/><br/>
Collaboration & Innovation: This project was developed over three months by a dedicated team of four, each bringing unique skills to the table.<br/><br/>

## Timeline<br/>
Our team worked intensively over three months to bring TANGO from a concept to a functional prototype. Each member contributed to every phase, including:<br/>

Design and Planning<br/>
Chassis and Drivetrain Assembly<br/>
Sensor Integration and Testing<br/>
Claw Mechanism and Control System Implementation<br/>
Final Testing and Optimization<br/>
